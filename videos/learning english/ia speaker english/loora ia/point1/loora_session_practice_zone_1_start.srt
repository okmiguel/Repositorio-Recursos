00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,120
So nice to meet you, Miguel. I'm Lura, your personal AI English tutor. Talk with me for

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,559
just five minutes a day and see how you become a confident English speaker. So tell me, where

3
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:32,879
are you from? Hello, Lura. Nice to meet you. My name is Miguel. I'm from Columbia, Latin America.

4
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:48,039
It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you. It's great to meet you. Columbia has such a rich

5
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:58,960
culture and beautiful landscapes. What do you love most about living there? Well, I was born

6
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:15,079
here. I don't know about other countries, but I like everything here, I believe. That's wonderful.

7
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:19,319
It's great that you appreciate everything about your home. If you could visit any country someday,

8
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:36,000
where would you like to go? Well, definitely the US, the United States, because when I was a child,

9
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I saw a lot of movies about, you know, Disney World, things like that. And I have a good image

10
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:54,879
of it. And one day I want to travel there. That sounds like an amazing dream. Just a small

11
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,519
correction. Instead of saying I see a lot of movies, you could say I saw a lot of movies

12
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:05,079
since you're talking about your childhood. Saw is the past tense, which fits better in this

13
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:08,280
context. What movies from Disney have you enjoyed the most?

14
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:38,240
Well, actually, I don't remember that one because, you know, when I was a child. But

15
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:57,280
Walt Disney makes movies for kids, you know. No worries at all. Disney movies can be really

16
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,520
memorable, even if we forget specific titles. Do you remember any characters or themes that

17
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:16,760
stood out to you from those movies? Well, I don't remember anything in particular about Disney,

18
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:22,360
but I remember other movies that I really like nowadays, such as The Matrix, for example. It's

19
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:37,640
a good movie. It's a science fiction action film. The Matrix is a fantastic choice. It really blends

20
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,040
action and thought provoking themes, doesn't it? What do you like most about that movie?

21
00:03:52,360 --> 00:04:05,240
Well, it's so interesting because it's like a reality, albeit an exaggerated one. Perhaps

22
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,760
something like that could happen in the future. I don't know.

23
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:28,199
That's a fascinating perspective. The idea of blending reality with technology makes it so

24
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:34,600
thought provoking. Do you enjoy other science fiction movies or is The Matrix your favorite?

25
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,960
Recently, I have seen several movies, including romance films. I enjoy them quite a bit as well.

26
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:54,759
For example, I recently watched a movie called Before Sunrise. It's a beautiful film. I don't

27
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:57,639
know if you're familiar with it, but Before Sunrise is a romance movie.

28
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:18,679
That's a fascinating perspective. The idea of blending reality with technology makes it

29
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,040
so thought provoking. Do you enjoy other science fiction movies or is The Matrix your favorite?

30
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:45,240
Recently, I have seen several movies, including romance films. I enjoy them quite a bit as well.

31
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,840
For example, I recently watched a movie called Before Sunrise. It's a beautiful film. I don't

32
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,960
know if you're familiar with it, but Before Sunrise is a romance movie.

33
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,079
Before Sunrise is a beautiful film. The way it captures a deep connection

34
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:11,720
between two people over just one night is really special.

35
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:27,000
Another movie that I saw today is The Notebook. It's another romance film that is just as beautiful.

36
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,720
The Notebook is such a heartfelt story. The emotions and the connection between the characters

37
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,480
really resonate with many people. Do you have a favorite scene from either of those romance movies?

38
00:06:49,720 --> 00:07:00,920
Well, another movie is Before Sunrise. In that film, I remember a scene that I really like.

39
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,000
It's when the boy tries to approach the girl and he attempts to get on the ride.

40
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,600
It's not really a roller coaster ride. It's more like a roller coaster ride.

41
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,840
The movie is about the same as the movie. It's not really a roller coaster ride. It's not like a roller

42
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,480
coaster ride. I remember thinking about it the whole time. I just like the way it was shot.

43
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:22,200
the ride. It's not really a roller coaster, it's part of the attractions, but I can't remember the

44
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,000
name of that ride. It was a little dangerous because he was trying to express that he wanted

45
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,200
to go out with her, but he jokingly pretended to commit suicide. I don't know if you're familiar

46
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,759
with that scene from before sunrise.

47
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:52,360
It sounds like you're talking about a memorable scene that really captures the intensity of young

48
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,879
love. The mix of humor and seriousness in that moment is what makes it so impactful.

49
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:04,120
Yes, exactly. That scene was so impactful because it was both dangerous and funny. The girl was so

50
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:27,800
intimidated by the guy, but he finally figured it out. He then went to the park and started

51
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:05,159
to take her out on a date. In the end, he achieved his goal with her, which was funny, but also a

52
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:07,159
little crazy.

53
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:38,599
That scene really highlights the mix of emotions that come with falling in love. It's interesting how humor can lighten even the most intense moments.

54
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:46,599
Yeah, you're right. I agree with you.

55
00:09:46,600 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm glad we agree. It's fascinating how love stories can intertwine humor and drama. Do you enjoy watching romance movies with friends or do you prefer to watch them alone?

56
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:21,399
It's equally important for me to be alone or to have company. I feel good whether I'm by myself or with others.

57
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:33,399
It's wonderful that you feel comfortable both alone and with company. It shows a great balance. It was great getting to know you today, and I look forward to our next lesson tomorrow.

58
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,399
See you tomorrow at 010, where I'll share your first daily word.
