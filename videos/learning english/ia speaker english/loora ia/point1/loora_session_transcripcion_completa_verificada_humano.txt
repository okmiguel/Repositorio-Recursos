Well definitely the US the United States because when I was a child I saw a lot of movies about you know Disney World things like that and I have a good image of it and one day I want to travel there

7:
That sounds like an amazing dream just a small correction instead of saying I see a lot of movies you could say I saw a lot of movies since you're talking about your childhood saw is the past tense which fits better in this context what movies from Disney have you enjoyed the most

8:
Well actually I don't remember that one because you know when I was a child but Walt Disney makes movies for kids you know

9:
No worries at all Disney movies can be really memorable even if we forget specific titles do you remember any characters or themes that stood out to you from those movies

10:
Well I don't remember anything in particular about Disney but I remember other movies that I really like nowadays such as the Matrix for example it's a good movie it's a science fiction action film

11:
The Matrix is a fantastic choice it really Blends action and thought-provoking themes doesn't it what do you like most about that movie

12:
Well it's so interesting because it's like a reality albeit an exaggerated one perhaps something like that could happen in the future I don't know

13:
That's a fascinating perspective the idea of blending reality with technology makes it so thought-provoking do you enjoy other science fiction movies or is the Matrix your favorite

14:
Recently I have seen several movies including romance films I enjoy them quite a bit as well for example I recently watched a movie called Before Sunrise it's a beautiful film I don't know if you're familiar with it but Before Sunrise is a romance movie

19:
The Notebook is such a heartfelt Story the emotions and the connection between the characters really resonate with many people do you have a favorite scene from either of those romance movies

20:
Well another movie is Before Sunrise in that film I remember a scene that I really like it's when the boy tries to approach the girl and he attempts to get on the ride it's not really a roller coaster it's part of the attractions but I can't remember the name of that ride it was a little dangerous because he was trying to express that he wanted to go out with her but he jokingly pretended to commit suicide I don't know if you're familiar with that scene from Before Sunrise

21:
It sounds like you're talking about a memorable scene that really captures the intensity of young love the mix of humor and seriousness in that moment is what makes it so impactful


22:
Yes exactly that scene was so impactful because it was both dangerous and funny the girl was so intimidated by the guy but he finally managed to convey that he wanted to take her out on a date in the end he achieved his goal with her which was funny but also a little crazy

27:
I'm glad we agree it's fascinating how love stories can intertwine humor and drama do you enjoy watching romance movies with friends or do you prefer to watch them alone
